      "I am currently fiddling around with an idea to remove transfer fees for e-shops payments. But I don&#x27;t know if it is a crazy idea that will never materialize. Anyhow it goes like this:<p>The e-shop embed an (additional) payment button and a script on the checkout form, just like with Stripe or Paypal. When the user clicks the button it will create a payment on my server with the relevant data from the e-shop, like bank account number, amount, currency, and open a new browser window on my site with the above payment information. This looks like this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;m1ltZNg.png<p>To complete the payment the user must install the Chrome extension and navigate to own your online bank, make the transfer to the e-shop&#x27;s bank account using the information given above. This is likely free. When the transfer have been made the user must export the transfer (or recent account transactions) to .CSV format, which many  banks offer. The Chrome extension will intercept this, verify the payment to the e-shop on my server and finally callback to the e-shop&#x27;s checkout form.<p>Could it work?<p>______<p>Thoughts:<p>Planning for launch in Germany (and EU) which has standardized CAMT formatting for data exports.<p>There should be some mechanism to verify that this works with a given online bank.",

I am trying to help build a pro European Hungarian political movement, Momentum (momentum.hu).<p>I believe technology has an important role to play in politics through opportunities for transparent, democratic decisions, and better workflows. I am curious how would you help a political organisation which is in its early stages?<p>One of our projects I am proud of is tackling local causes which matter to local people. cselekveskorei.hu is our website where we run this platform.<p>I would love to hear about your experiences in helping setting up political orgs with tech and what you would do to help improve processes.

      "Hey HN, has anybody struggled to really grok time dilation like me but succeeded? If yes, what was the ultimate resource that helped you do it?<p>I am a Software Engineer and really into astronomy for the whole my life, but for the life of me can`t really understand time dilation. For example :<p>- If you travel at the speed of light (impossible but for the sake of argument), does time &quot;stops&quot; for you in the sense that there is no motion in you, your atoms are &quot;frozen&quot;?<p>- Same applies when you are near the ultra massive object, but I can`t understand why would mass impact it in that way. I understand it bends spacetime, but why would it slow time by much and will it be the same &quot;slowness as in the first case?<p>- If you are the only object in the universe and there is no reference point, do same logic&#x2F;laws apply? If you speed up, accelerate, does anything change related to &quot;time&quot;. My logical brain says yes, but reading all these explanations about time dilation makes me wondering.<p>- All the examples focus on the points in local time where observers &quot;see&quot; an event (light from the other source coming), but I can`t transfer that into different &quot;speed&quot; of local time (related to the first point)<p>Yeah, enough confusion for now.. I won`t even go to the quantum world now..",

      "Hi everyone,<p>I&#x27;m delighted to share my latest and pretty simple venture.<p>I thought what if I can build a simple tool for non-programmers to start using prediction in their day to day life, just like using it with MS Excel or their own app, which I really enjoy nowadays :).<p>Been working away on the MVP for most of the last month, so it&#x27;s awesome to be able to keep working on it has got the &quot;launch&quot; out of the way. I&#x27;ve been lucky to have some great friends trying it out for weeks now and helping me shape it, so this doesn&#x27;t feel like a huge event, just another step in iterating to keep improving the product.<p>Please check it out and let me know your feedback, you&#x27;re always awesome - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictEasy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictEasy.com</a>",

      "Hey all. Throwaway for obvious reasons.<p>I work at a large company as a software developer. Unfortunately, many of the teams are not up-to-date technically speaking.<p>When I was brought on I was quickly able to pick all of the low hanging fruit. Because of this I have become quite reputable in the company and have been promoted.<p>Despite this, I still don&#x27;t feel very strong technically because of the fact that the problems I have been solving really should&#x27;ve been solved before my arrival. Being on here, I have an inferiority complex as my perceived ability is not commensurate with my title at other companies.<p>In particular -- despite having a few years of experience I haven&#x27;t actually done anything at scale. Meaning the 100,000s of users (most I&#x27;ve done is 10,000s of internal users and customers). I feel like I haven&#x27;t actually done serious software engineering work.<p>I was wondering if anyone has been in this position, being prominent in their company but still feeling poor technically. I feel if I were to interview at say, Dropbox I wouldn&#x27;t do well just because I&#x27;m not practicing the right things at work.<p>Is quitting the only option, or is there a way for me to introduce solutions to problems that may require more technical expertise, to better not only myself but the company as well?<p>TLDR: Is it normal to not do &quot;serious&quot; software development work early in your career? Perfect example of this is the NYT article on scaling puzzles. I feel I&#x27;m currently not in a position to make those kind of decisions, and can only maybe 50% at most understand the rationale behind them.",
